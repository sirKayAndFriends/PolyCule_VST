# Versatile Overdrive
An overdrive and distortion VST with a variety of voice and clipping options!
Guitar overdrive pedals often emphasise a set of frequencies alongside their clipping arrangements.  This pedal covers all the sounds in one box!  Read on to discover more!!

## Introduction
**Voice and Hump Controls**
Control the centre frequency and amount of boost for the overdrive.  The **Voice** knob controls where on the frequency spectrum the boost will sit and the **Hump** knob 
controls how much that frequency is boosted, from "flat" to 8x gain.  The **Voice** knob slides from 600hz to 2000hz to cover the range from Tubescreamer, through Rat to 
treble boost.  This section is pre-clipping so will inherently affect the amount of distortion available

**Clipping**
Choose your style of diode-like clipping with the **Clip** button: Soft or Hard clipping.  In Hard-Clipping mode the **Diode** buttons allow you to choose your 
arrangement: Number of diodes (1 - 4) and their symmetrical arrangement.
